## Introduction

Time series forecasting is a critical aspect of business planning, especially in the retail sector. This project focuses on predicting the sales of organic avocados in the U.S. by employing various time series forecasting techniques.

## Data Loading and Preprocessing

The initial step involves loading the dataset and preprocessing it to filter relevant information. The dataset is refined to include only organic avocado sales in the U.S. The preprocessing step handles missing data and ensures the correct date format.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to understand yearly and monthly trends in avocado sales. Visualizations help identify patterns and insights that contribute to the forecasting models.

## Time Series Decomposition

The time series is decomposed into its components – trend, seasonality, and residual – to better understand the underlying patterns and structures within the data.

## Exponential Smoothing

Exponential Smoothing techniques, specifically Holt-Winters, are applied to find the best forecasting model for the avocado sales time series. The model's performance is evaluated based on its ability to capture the observed patterns.

## SARIMA Model (Seasonal ARIMA)

Grid search is performed to optimize parameters for Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA). The model is fitted to the log-transformed training data, and diagnostics plots help assess its performance.

## Model Evaluation

The SARIMA model is evaluated using various diagnostics plots and error metrics. The comparison is made based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).

## Prophet Model

The data is converted to meet the requirements of the Facebook Prophet model. The Prophet model is applied to the dataset, and its performance is assessed using error metrics.

## Stationarity Testing and Differencing

To ensure the stationarity of the time series, stationarity testing is performed using rolling statistics and the Dickey-Fuller test. Log transformation and differencing are applied accordingly.

## ARIMA Model

Grid search is employed to find the optimal parameters for an AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. The model is fitted and evaluated based on its ability to forecast avocado sales.

## Model Comparison and Class Definition

The SARIMA models are compared based on AIC and BIC. A class for SARIMA modeling is defined to streamline the process for different model variations.

## Error Metrics and Forecasting

Error metrics are calculated to assess the accuracy of the forecasts generated by the SARIMA and Prophet models. The forecasts are compared to the actual sales data to determine the effectiveness of each model.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive exploration of time series forecasting techniques for predicting organic avocado sales. The comparison of multiple models ensures the selection of the most accurate forecasting approach for business planning and decision-making.
